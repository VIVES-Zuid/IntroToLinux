# 13. Best Practices


### Efficiency Tips:
- Put filters early in pipelines to reduce data
- Use appropriate tools for each task
- Consider memory usage with large datasets
- Test complex pipelines step by step

### Debugging Pipelines:
- Test each stage separately
- Use `tee` to inspect intermediate results
- Add `-v` flags for verbose output when available
- Use temporary files for complex processing

### Regular Expressions:
- Start simple and build complexity gradually
- Test regex patterns with `grep` before using in scripts
- Use online regex testers for complex patterns
- Document complex regex patterns
