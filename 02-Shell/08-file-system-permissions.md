# 6. File System Permissions


### Security Principles:
- Linux is very secure by design
- Users can only create/modify files in their home directory
- System-wide changes require administrator (root) privileges
- Everything else is read-only for regular users

### Permission Levels:
- **Read (r)**: View file contents or list directory
- **Write (w)**: Modify file or create/delete files in directory  
- **Execute (x)**: Run file as program or enter directory
