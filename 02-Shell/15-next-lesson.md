## Summary of Lesson 2

You've now mastered the fundamentals of the Linux shell and file system navigation:

- Understanding the console and terminal origins
- Navigating the Linux file system structure
- Using essential navigation and file commands
- Getting help with commands and documentation
- Working with file permissions and user types

## Before Moving to Lesson 3

**🎯 Test Your Skills:** Complete the [File System Navigation Quiz](05-file-system-navigation-quiz.md) to practice your navigation skills with 30 challenging questions covering absolute and relative paths.

## What's Next: Lesson 3 - Shell Environment and Variables

In the next lesson, you'll dive deeper into the shell environment:

### Topics We'll Cover:
- **Environment Variables**: Understanding and managing system configuration
- **Command History**: Efficiently recalling and editing previous commands
- **Shell Configuration**: Customizing your shell environment
- **PATH Variable**: Understanding how the system finds commands
- **Advanced Environment Concepts**: Mastering shell behavior

### Why This Matters:
- **Productivity**: Configure your environment for maximum efficiency
- **Automation**: Set up variables and aliases for repetitive tasks
- **Troubleshooting**: Understand how the shell finds and executes commands
- **Customization**: Personalize your Linux experience

### Prerequisites Check:
Before starting Lesson 3, ensure you can:
- ✅ Navigate the file system using `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`
- ✅ Understand absolute vs relative paths
- ✅ Use basic file operations (`cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`)
- ✅ Access help documentation (`man`, `--help`)
- ✅ Complete the navigation quiz successfully

### Getting Ready:
1. **Practice Navigation**: Complete the [File System Navigation Quiz](05-file-system-navigation-quiz.md)
2. **Review Commands**: Make sure you're comfortable with all commands from this lesson
3. **Set Up Practice Environment**: Ensure you have access to a Linux terminal
