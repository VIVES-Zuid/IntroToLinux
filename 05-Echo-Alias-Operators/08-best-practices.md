# 8. Best Practices


### Alias Guidelines:
- Keep aliases short and memorable
- Don't override important system commands
- Document complex aliases
- Use functions for complex logic

### Quote Usage:
- Use double quotes for variables and command substitution
- Use single quotes for literal strings
- Always quote file names with spaces
- Quote variables in scripts: `"$VAR"`

### Control Operators:
- Use `&&` for dependent operations
- Use `||` for error handling
- Check `$?` for detailed error analysis
- Use `;` when order matters but dependencies don't

### Line Continuation:
- Break long commands for readability
- Align continuation lines consistently
- Use in scripts for maintainability
