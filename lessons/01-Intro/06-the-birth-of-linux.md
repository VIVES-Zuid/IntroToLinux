![Linus Torvalds](../images/LinusTorvalds.png)

## The Story
In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, began working on his own operating system kernel as a hobby project. He was inspired by MINIX but wanted to create something more capable.

## Original Announcement (August 25, 1991):
*"I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones."*

## Why "Linux"?
- Originally called "Freax" (free + freak + Unix)
- The name "Linux" comes from "Linus' Unix"
- First kernel version: 0.01 (September 1991)
- Version 1.0 released in March 1994

## Linux Today:
- Powers most web servers
- Runs on supercomputers
- Used in Android devices
- Foundation for many enterprise systems
- Completely free and open source
